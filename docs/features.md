Proxima, while not offering too much in commands out-of-the-box; provides robust tools to help you create your own bot to suit your needs.

- Custom [`Utils.js`](/) to ease interaction with Discord API
- [**Addon Handler**] to create the infrastructure for [First](/docs/Developers/Addons/first-party) and [Third](/docs/Developers/Addons/third-party) party addons.
- Our very own [**Event Handler**](https://github.com/NeuShore/Proxima/blob/dev/Modules/Handlers/EventHandler.js) to save you from creating your own.
- Installation installations and active support
- Actively Maintained
- Always free and open source
