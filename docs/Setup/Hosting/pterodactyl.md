# Pterodactyl Hosting

---



:::danger Unsupported!
Pterodactyl is currently **unsupported** and the instructions below are left only for archiving purposes. Please join our [Discord Server](/discord) if you would like to request support with installing Proxima on Pterodactyl. The official Pterodactyl Egg is __OUTDATED__.
:::

[Pterodactyl Panel](https://pterodactyl.io/) is a server management panel that is used by many hosting providers.
If you are using a Hosting Provider, you should take a look at our Using a Hosting Provider below. This only covers instructions for **self-hosted** Pterodactyl instances.

## Installing Proxima on Pterodactyl

### Self-Hosted Pterodactyl
Start by downloading our [Official Pterodactyl Egg](/) and create a server on your Pterodactyl Panel using the Pterodactyl Egg. (Video Instructions Below)

You may also install additional node modules directly from **Settings > Variables > Node Modules** section. Simply add the names of the modules you'd like to install and reboot.

The Pterodactyl Egg allows you to customize your bot's settings directly from the **Variables** section under **Settings**.

### Using a Provider (Hosting Company)

Using a Provider is _not recommended_ due to the nature of most hosting providers and the scope of control you will have on your machine. However if you really would like to use a hosting provider (probably because it's cheaper) make sure that their **NodeJS** version is **16.6.0** or higher.

We recommend [Revivenode](https://revivenode.com/discord.html) to host Proxima.

#### Installation

**Using a NodeJS Egg**
If you are not allowed to upload your own egg but to choose from a batch of NodeJS eggs; you may initialize a server using a NodeJS v16 egg and then upload the files. Simply choose the correct NodeJS version, upload the .zip file to the panel and then extract the zip.

**Using Official Pterodactyl Egg**
If you are allowed to uplaod custom Pterodactyl Eggs, then you can use our [Official Pterodactyl Egg](/) which will download the bot as well as its dependencies.

If you have customized the source code of the bot or would like to use the [unstable Dev Branch](/) then you are still advised to go with a NodeJS egg.
