3. Community developers are not to create their own addon servers until they reach an amount of 5 free addons,
   - This is to prevent a bloated amount of public servers from popping up and allowing community members to personally experience a developer's talents

5. You are not allowed to publish addons explicitly made another Third Party Developer under any conditions.

   - BrayanBot Discord Server
   - Your own support server after meeting the requirements to create one
   - Discord Private Messages

   - You, for the period of time you hold the title of **Community Developer** and benefit from said title, are bound by this agreement and are required to follow terms listed within this document.

## Resources Submitted

1. Submitted resources may not contain any piece of code with the intention of benefiting the developer from the user's hardware or software.
2. No NSFW content is allowed for public addons.
