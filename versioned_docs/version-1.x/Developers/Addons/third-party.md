# Third Party Addons

---

Third Party Addons are addons that are created by developers that are kindly contributing to the BrayanBot community and are referred to as the "**Community Developers**". While they may offer addons in various shapes and forms (obfuscated, non-obfuscated); Community Developers are responsible for submitting their work for verification before publishing addons publicly and we, as BrayanBot developers will always ensure that addons published by **Community Developers** do not contain any malicious bits.

:::warning
While we will do our best to scan all addons submitted for verification for malicious content; we can not guarantee that addons that are published on non-verified websites will share the same quality. That is why you are highly encouraged to download addons from official sources like [Coremart](https://coremart.net/resources/discord/brayanbot/)
:::

Some addon developers may also be providing private commissions for a price, but do keep in mind that **we do not monitor** those private commissions and cannot guarantee the safety of those. Please only commission developers that have a clear track record of publishing safe-to-use addons.

If you have created your own addon, you are still expected to **verify said addon** before publicizing it.
