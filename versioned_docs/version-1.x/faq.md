**A:** You should -in theory- be able be able to run BrayanBot on any platform supporting latest NodeJS but we (currently) only provide instructions and support for the following:

- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Arch and their derivatives)
- Windows - not recommended
- MacOS

**Q:** I would like to develop my own addons, how can I do that?

**A:** You will want to start by reading [Creating your Own Addons](/docs/Developers/Addons/creating-addons) page.

**Q:** Can I use Corebot addons on BrayanBot?

**A:** Short answer is "no." This is due to the fact that Corebot and BrayanBot use their own, separate utilities, addon handlers and event handlers. However, you may ask a [community developer](/docs/Developers/Addons/third-party) to recreate Corebot addons with BrayanBot compatibility.
