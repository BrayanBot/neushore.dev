[![Deploy]()]()

## Introduction

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```
$ yarn
```

## Local Development

```
$ yarn dev
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to the branch `gh-pages` on repository `brayanbotdev.github.io` each time the `main` branch receives a new push. The GitHub Action workflow file is stored at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml.`

## Contributing

- [Submit bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/brayanbot/brayanbot.dev), and help us verify as they are checked in.
- Review the [website](https://brayanbot.dev) and make pull requests for anything from typos to new content suggestion.
